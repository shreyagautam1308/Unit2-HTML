    <h1>What is an Operating System?</h1>
    <p>Operating System lies in the category of system software. It basically manages all the resources of the computer. An operating system acts as an interface between the software and different parts of the computer or the computer hardware. The operating system is designed in such a way that it can manage the overall resources and operations of the computer. 

        Operating System is a fully integrated set of specialized programs that handle all the operations of the computer. It controls and monitors the execution of all other programs that reside in the computer, which also includes application programs and other system software of the computer. Examples of Operating Systems are Windows, Linux, Mac OS, etc.</p>

    <h2><b>Types of Operating systems</b></h2>
    <p>There are several types of Operating Systems which are mentioned below.

        Batch Operating System
        Multi-Programming System
        Multi-Processing System
        Multi-Tasking Operating System
        Time-Sharing Operating System
        Distributed Operating System
        Network Operating System
        Real-Time Operating System</p>
    <h2>Functions of Operating systems</h2>
    <p>An Operating System acts as a communication bridge (interface) between the user and computer hardware. The purpose of an operating system is to provide a platform on which a user can execute programs conveniently and efficiently.

        An operating system is a piece of software that manages the allocation of Computer Hardware. The coordination of the hardware must be appropriate to ensure the correct working of the computer system and to prevent user programs from interfering with the proper working of the system. 
        
        The main goal of the Operating System is to make the computer environment more convenient to use and the Secondary goal is to use the resources most efficiently. </p>
    <h2>Process Management</h2>
    <p>Process management is a key part of an operating system. It controls how processes are carried out, and controls how your computer runs by handling the active processes. This includes stopping processes, setting which processes should get more attention, and many more. You can manage processes on your own computer too.

        The OS is responsible for managing the start, stop, and scheduling of processes, which are programs running on the system. The operating system uses a number of methods to prevent deadlocks, facilitate inter-process communication, and synchronize processes. Efficient resource allocation, conflict-free process execution, and optimal system performance are all guaranteed by competent process management. This essential component of an operating system enables the execution of numerous applications at once, enhancing system utilization and responsiveness.</p>
